1.0 System Requirements


    In order to run EZ Intranet Messenger, Java Runtime Environment 1.6.0 is
needed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 Installation


    Extract contents from the archive.  For example, if your PC is running
Linux and have "unzip" installed, simply type in "unzip ezim-1.x.x.zip".  A
directory containing all the necessary contents to run EZIM will be created.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0 Running EZIM


    Execute EZIM with the following command:

    on Linux:

        $ java -jar <path to EZIM's directory>/ezim.jar &

    on Windows:

        C:\> javaw -jar <path to EZIM's directory>\ezim.jar

    * Windows users should be able to execute EZIM by double clicking on the
JAR file directly.

4.0 FAQ


Q: What is the listbox with little icons inside for?

A: It is the state icon which represents your current state and gives your
   peers a general idea how you are being or what you are doing.  For
   example, your can tell the other users that you're talking on the phone
   by simply selecting the classic black phone state icon.  Or you can tell
   your peers that you don't want to be disturbed by showing them the "no
   entry" sign.


Q: Why I can't leave the status textbox empty?

A: Due to our connection policy, every connected user must have a brief
   verbal description to tell the other users that he/she is indeed
   connected to the network.  If you leave the status textbox empty, a
   single word "Online" will be used to describe about your status.


Q: How do I change my nickname?

A: We don't encourage users to change their nickname often because it is the
   only way a user can be recognized.  That is why we don't provide an easy
   GUI way to do the task.  Nonetheless, if you really want to change your
   nickname, you can delete the whole configuration directory, then all
   settings will be re-initialized and you will be asked to enter the
   nickname again.

   On Windows, the configuration directory is known as "%HOME%\.ezim".
   On Linux, it is "$HOME/.ezim".


Q: Why does the state icon change to something which is not I have chosen
   when I open the plaza (public chat) window?

A: When the plaza window is open, a user is supposed to be chatting in the
   plaza instead of being away or whatsoever.  The plaza state icon here
   works as an indicator which tells other users who is/are chatting in the
   plaza.  When the user finishes chatting and closes the plaza window, the
   state icon will be restored to what is being selected.


Q: What are multicast group IP, multicast group port, and direct
   transmission port used for?  Why should I care about them?

A: Multicast group IP (default: 229.0.0.1) and multicast group port
   (default: 5555) are used for network-segment-wide communications.  This
   kind of transmissions will reach all the peers in the same network
   segment.  Contact information retrievals, status change notifications,
   and plaza conversations fall into this category.  In order to communicate
   with other peers in the same network segment, these settings have to
   match with your peers'.

   Direct transmission port (default: 6666) is opened to receive
   communications which are destinated to you directly from the peers.  You
   can change it to something else to avoid conflict if you have other
   applications alreadily listening to the default port.

   If you have no idea what the above means, simply leave the settings to
   default and everything should work just fine.

5.0 Trouble Shooting


Q: Why I can't see other users?

A: First of all, make sure that you are on the same network segment with the
   other users.  If you were in the same network segment with your peers,
   make sure your network supports multicast.  If you have no idea about it,
   ask your network administrator.  If all these are cleared and you still
   cannot see other users, try clicking on the refresh button to query the
   contact list manually.


Q: There are users on the contact whom I can't send message to, why?

A: Either the users you are trying to send message to have their firewalls
   blocking the transmissions, or there are firewalls in your machine
   preventing connections getting out.

   In order to receive messages from the peers, the direct transmission port
   (default: 6666) has to be open for incoming direct transmission. If there
   is any firewall running on the system, you'll have to make sure the
   specific port is open to your peers. 
 
   On Linux, you can do something like this with iptables as root: 
   # iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -dport 6666 -j ACCEPT 

   Or alternatively, you can change the direct transmission port's setting
   to avoid it from being blocked.
 
   Also, if you can't see your peers, or the status update does not seem to
   work, check and see if the firewall is blocking any multicast signals.
   With iptables, see if there is anything like these, if so, remove it: 
 
   iptables -A -p all -d 229.0.0.1 -j DROP
   iptables -A INPUT -m pkttype --pkt-type broadcast -j DROP
   iptables -A INPUT -m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j DROP


NOTE:

   The above scenarios are based on the assumption that all network settings
   are set to default.
