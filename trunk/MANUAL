4.0 FAQ


Q: What is the listbox with little icons inside for?

A: It is the state icon which represents your current state and gives your
   peers a general idea how you are being or what you are doing.  For
   example, your can tell the other users that you're talking on the phone
   by simply selecting the classic black phone state icon.  Or you can tell
   your peers that you don't want to be disturbed by showing them the "no
   entry" sign.


Q: Why I can't leave the status textbox empty?
A: Due to our connection policy, every connected user must have a brief
   verbal description to tell the other users that he/she is indeed
   connected to the network.  If you leave the status textbox empty, a
   single word "Online" will be used to describe about your status.


Q: How do I change my nickname?

A: We don't encourage users changing their nickname often because it is the
   only way a user can be recognized.  Nonetheless, If you really want to
   change your nickname, you can delete the whole configuration directory,
   then all settings will be re-initialized and you will be asked to enter
   the nickname again.

   On Windows, the configuration directory is known as "%HOME%\.ezim".
   On Linux, it is "$HOME/.ezim".


Q: Why does the state icon change to something which is not I have chosen
   when I open the plaza (public chat) window?

A: When the plaza window is open, a user is supposed to be chatting in the
   plaza instead of being away or whatsoever.  The plaza state icon here
   works as an indicator which tells other users who is/are chatting in the
   plaza.  When the user finishes chatting and closes the plaza window, the
   state icon will be restored to what is being selected.

5.0 Trouble Shooting


Q: Why I can't see other users?

A: First of all, make sure that you are on the same network segment with the
   other users.  If you were in the same network segment with your peers,
   make sure your network supports multicast.  If you have no idea about it,
   ask your network administrator.  If all these are cleared and you still
   cannot see other users, try clicking on the refresh button to query the
   contact list manually.


Q: There users on the contact whom I can't send message to, why?

A: Either the users you are trying to send message to have their firewalls
   blocking the transmissions, or there are firewalls in your machine
   preventing connections getting out.

   In order to receive messages from the peers, the port 6666 has to be
   open for incoming direct transmission. If there is any firewall running
   on the system, you'll have to make sure the specific port is open to your
   peers. 
 
   On Linux, you can do something like this with iptables as root: 
   # iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -s 192.168.1.0/24 -dport 6666 -j ACCEPT 
 
   Also, if you can't see your peers, or the status update does not seem to
   work, check and see if the firewall is blocking any multicast signals.
   With iptables, see if there is something like this, if so, remove it: 
 
   iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -d 229.0.0.1 -j DROP
